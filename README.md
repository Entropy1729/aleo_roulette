# Aleo Roulette

Roulette web app with ZKP.

## Disclaimer.

This is a toy example, the random number is generated in a deterministic way through a seed. The seed is equal to the roulette spin counter number. 

The random number is generated by applying the Poseidon Hash Function available in Aleo Instructions to the seed and then applying mod(36) to the last 6 bits. This mod operation is performed outside the circuits and then verified within them. In a future version, the mod operation will be calculated by an Aleo Instruction integrally.
